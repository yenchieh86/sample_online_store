# Kimberly's One Stop Shop

Help my client Kimberly to create her online shop

* Used Ruby on Rails to create an eCommerce store with a shopping cart system, a dropdown menu, and a Stripe payment system

* Used Carrierwave, fog, AWS S3 to upload photos of the products and USPS API to include the ability to check mailing addresses 

* Maintain the functionality of the store by debugging any reported issues and designing new features to make the store more user friendly
